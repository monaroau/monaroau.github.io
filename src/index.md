I'm just your average, ordinary, every day kid.
<br>
I've been developing software for many years. I have experience with the full web stack for all the major
internet technologies. As long as I've been around I know there is always more to learn and I learn
something
new each and every day. If I don't know how to do something then I can find out. I prefer Javascript and
Node.js
but anything is ok with me.
