title: 'Checking out the AIs'
body: "I've been checking out the AIs. ChatGPT, meta.ai, Google Gemini, Microsoft Co-Pilot. I mean it's pretty cool tech but.... I mean it's nice to have another resource to draw from to do my job and I guess everyone feels that way. I don't think it will take over the world just yet though. I created this image with meta.ai for free. Check it out."
