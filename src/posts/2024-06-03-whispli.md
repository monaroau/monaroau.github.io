title: 'Whispli Co-Founder'
body: 'I started Whispli with 2 friends. I was the only technical person in the company at the time so I created the first version of the SAAS platform.
The platform went through many iterations before a complete rebuild.
We went through many rounds of penetration testing and picked up some pretty prestegious customers. The business was also able to achieve ISO-27001 certification.'
