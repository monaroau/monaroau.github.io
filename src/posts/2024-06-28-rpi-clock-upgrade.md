title: 'Raspberry Pi Clock Upgrade'
body: "This 90s-era alarm clock has undergone a significant upgrade after sitting unused for many years. Seeking a new project, I set my sights on revamping this old beauty. The objective was clear: keep it cost-effective, enhance its utility, and inject some fun into it. For the brains, the Raspberry Pi Pico W emerged as the perfect choice due to its compact size, built-in Wi-Fi capability, and affordability. To modernize the display, I opted for a 16x2 LCD screen with I2C connectivity, seamlessly integrating with the RPi and fulfilling the project requirements. Now, the clock can display two different time zones simultaneously. Adding a touch of fun, the clock fetches jokes from an API throughout the day, scrolling them across the screen. Programmed in MicroPython, this project has given the clock a new lease on life."
