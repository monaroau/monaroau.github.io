title: 'Lego prototyping'
body: "Here is my weather station powered by a Raspberry Pi Zero W. Written in Python the Pi connects to the API of the Bureau of Meteorology and displays the data twice an hour. To reduce power consumption on the unit I utilised an e-paper display which doesn't require power to maintain an image. To package the prototype I used some of my kids Lego which is a really versatile and quick way to realise a design."
